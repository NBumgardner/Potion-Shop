# Potion-Shop
This is a potion shop-running simulation game created in 8 weeks by Sam Bumgardner and Alex Mullins, a pair of students from Missouri State University.

The main purpose of this project was to build a fun game while building a flexible UI system that could (hopefully) be reused in future projects.

## Overview

Play as an entrepreneurial alchemist in a growing frontier town. Purchase mysterious ingredients, brew powerful potions, and sell them to townsfolk and adventurers alike!

The game is still in development, but check back later to try out the game in your browser!

## Getting Started

To build and run Potion-Shop on Windows or Linux (note: only tested on Windows), follow the steps below:

1. Ensure you have [Haxe](http://www.haxe.org/download) and [HaxeFlixel](http://www.haxeflixel.com) installed on your computer.
  * Installing HaxeFlixel should also automatically install [OpenFl](http://www.openfl.org/learn/docs/getting-started/) and [Lime](https://lib.haxe.org/p/lime).
2. Clone or download this repository to your computer.	
3. Open a command prompt in the newly created `\Potion-Shop` folder.
4. Run the command `haxelib run lime test neko` to build and run the executable.
  * The executable is located in `\Potion-Shop\export\windows\neko\bin`.
  * To run in debug mode, run the command `haxlib run lime test -debug neko`. The debug console can be accessed with the backquote key.
